# RGADocu
- A program which accepts the data of members within a church. The program is to be used as a simple replacement from the archaic method of hand writing the details of individuals in a church 
- This program is no longer in development. However changes could be made to suit another persons need.

### Core Technical Concepts
- This project exist as a solution to the documentation issues faced by Rehboth Gospel Assembly.
- This project supports: Accepting Personal data, ministry involvement and attendance logging 

### Installing
- This program required no outside dependcies and runs perfectly fine outside of the box

### Things To Note
-	The program, because of technical limitations, wonâ€™t be able to automatically call upon the unique 7-digit ID each member will have and to be used as reference in the C Code.
-	The system can only add up to 100 members any given time.
- The program will have an old and unintuitive UI.
